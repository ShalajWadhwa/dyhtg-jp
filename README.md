# DYHTG Hackathon
DYHTG short for 'Do You Have The Guts' is an annual hackathon hosted by the Glasgow University Tech Society (GUTS).

### JP Morgan Challange
The 2022 JP Morgan challange was to create a dashboard for managers to monitor certain conditions of each employee (up to interpretation).

### Freighty
The team used this challange to create a logistics platform called Freighty for freight transportation companies. The platform equips managers with a dashboard to easily visualise the news and weather warnings of the location the driver is present at, allowing them to better estimate shipment times.
